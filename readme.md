## How It Works

### The Algorithm

RedditJams uses a multi-step process to generate highly personalized recommendations:

#### **Step 1: Playlist Analysis**
- Connects to Spotify API using your playlist URL
- Extracts all tracks with metadata (name, artist, popularity, etc.)
- Selects **9 diverse tracks** for analysis (configurable):
  - **Top 3** most popular tracks (NUM_TOP_TRACKS = 3)
  - **Bottom 3** least popular tracks (NUM_BOTTOM_TRACKS = 3)
  - **3 random** tracks from the middle range (NUM_RANDOM_TRACKS = 3)
- Selects **6 diverse artists** for analysis (configurable):
  - **Top 2** artists from your playlist (NUM_TOP_ARTISTS = 2)
  - **Bottom 2** artists from your playlist (NUM_BOTTOM_ARTISTS = 2)
  - **2 random** artists from the middle range (NUM_RANDOM_ARTISTS = 2)

#### **Step 2: Reddit Community Search (Parallel)**
The system searches Reddit's r/music community in parallel for similar music tastes:

**Track-Based Searches (9 parallel queries):**
- For each of your 9 diverse tracks, searches Reddit for: `"[track name] [artist] recommend"`
- Example: `"Running Up That Hill Kate Bush recommend"`
- Finds posts where users recommend songs similar to your selections
- Includes top hits, hidden gems, and random discoveries from your playlist

**Artist-Based Searches (6 parallel queries):**
- For each of your 6 diverse artists, searches Reddit for: `"[artist name] recommend similar"`
- Example: `"Kate Bush recommend similar"`
- Finds posts recommending artists/songs similar to your selections
- Covers well-known and lesser-known artists from your library

**Total: 15 simultaneous Reddit searches** - All executed in parallel for maximum speed and diversity

**Keyword Filtering:**
Only keeps posts/comments containing recommendation keywords:
- "recommend"
- "similar to"
- "if you like"
- "check out"
- "you might like"
- "fans of"
- "try"

#### **Step 3: AI-Powered Analysis**
- Sends your playlist data + Reddit recommendations to **GPT-4**
- GPT-4 analyzes patterns in your music taste
- Considers community recommendations from Reddit
- Generates **5 new song suggestions** (not in your original playlist) in order from most to least recomended
- Returns songs as JSON: `[{"song": "Title", "artist": "Artist"}, ...]`

#### **Step 4: Spotify Verification**
- Searches Spotify for each GPT-4 recommendation
- Retrieves full track details (album art, preview URLs, popularity, etc.)
- Ensures all recommendations are real, playable songs
- Returns complete track information with direct Spotify links

#### **Step 5: Results Delivery**
- Returns formatted JSON response with all recommendations
- Includes metadata about the recommendation process and the users playlist
- Ready to display in the application

| Top Artists | 2 | Number of top artists to analyze |
| Bottom Artists | 2 | Number of bottom artists to analyze |
| Random Artists | 2 | Number of random artists to analyze (total = 6) |

## Why It Works

**Community Intelligence:** Reddit's music community shares authentic recommendations based on real listening experiences, not just algorithmic similarities.

**Diverse Selection:** Analyzes top hits, hidden gems, and random discoveries from your playlist, ensuring recommendations aren't biased toward only your most popular tracks.

**Multi-Source Analysis:** Combines your actual playlist data with community wisdom, providing recommendations that are both personalized AND discovery-oriented.

**AI Understanding:** GPT-4 understands music context, genres, moods, and can identify nuanced patterns that simple collaborative filtering misses.

**Parallel Processing:** All 15 Reddit searches run simultaneously using async/await, making the API fast despite searching multiple queries.

**Real Spotify Integration:** Every recommendation is verified on Spotify with full metadata, ensuring you can instantly play any suggested song.

3. Selects 6 diverse artists (top 2, bottom 2, random 2) for varied perspectives
4. Searches Reddit for 15 different recommendation queries in parallel
5. Finds 62+ Reddit posts with music recommendations
6. GPT-4 analyzes all data and suggests 5 new songs
7. Verifies all songs exist on Spotify
8. Returns complete track information with links

**Result:**
You get 5 personalized song recommendations you've never heard, based on your taste + community wisdom, ready to play on Spotify.

## Privacy & Data

- **No Data Storage:** The API doesn't store your playlist data or recommendations
- **No Authentication Required:** Public playlists can be analyzed without Spotify login
- **Read-Only Access:** Only reads playlist data, never modifies your Spotify account
- **Anonymous Reddit Search:** Searches public Reddit posts, no account needed

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use Diverse Playlists:** Playlists with varied tracks get more interesting recommendations
2. **Include Popular Songs:** Well-known tracks have more Reddit discussions
3. **Genre Consistency:** Playlists focused on specific genres get more relevant suggestions
4. **Longer Playlists:** More tracks = better understanding of your taste (ideal: 30+ songs)
